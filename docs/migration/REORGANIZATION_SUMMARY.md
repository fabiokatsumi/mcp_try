# üìã MCP Server Reorganization Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Reorganized Project Structure**
   - Created a professional, modular directory structure
   - Implemented separation of concerns (server, tools, config, docs, etc.)
   - Created package markers for proper Python packaging

2. **Migrated Core Components**
   - Moved `secure_server.py` to the new structure
   - Created modular components for authentication, rate limiting, etc.
   - Implemented tool registry system

3. **Created Deployment Infrastructure**
   - Added production Dockerfile
   - Added Dokploy deployment configuration and scripts
   - Created environment templates and health check scripts

4. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Updated README with production focus
   - Created deployment guides
   - Organized security documentation

5. **Improved Testing Framework**
   - Created test directories for unit, integration, and security tests
   - Migrated existing tests to the new structure

6. **Added Validation**
   - Created validation script to verify project structure
   - Fixed import issues for proper modular code

## üîê Security Focus

The reorganized project is now focused on the secure server implementation with proper authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring. Key security features include:

1. **API Key Authentication**: Secure access control with proper key generation and validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
3. **Monitoring**: Detailed logging and performance tracking
4. **Secure Deployment**: Proper container security with non-root user
5. **Environment Management**: Separation of development and production environments

## üìã Future Improvements

1. **Complete Tool Implementations**: Add more tool implementations in `src/tools/implementations/`
2. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement advanced monitoring features
3. **Add CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and deployment
4. **Improve Documentation**: Add more detailed API documentation
5. **Add More Tests**: Expand test coverage

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Remove deprecated files (app.py, http_server.py, etc.)
2. Complete any remaining import fixes
3. Deploy to Dokploy VPS
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

The project is now ready for production deployment on Dokploy VPS, with a clean, professional structure that follows best practices for Python projects and secure web services.
