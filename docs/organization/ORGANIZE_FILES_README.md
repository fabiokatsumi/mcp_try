# ðŸš€ MCP Server File Organization

## What's Been Done

1. **Created a Comprehensive File Organization Plan**
   - A detailed plan is now available in `FILE_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md`
   - The plan categorizes all files and specifies where they should be located
   - This creates a clean, professional project structure

2. **Developed a File Organization Script**
   - `organize_files.py` will automatically implement the organization plan
   - The script creates directories, moves files, and cleans up empty directories
   - It provides detailed output of all operations performed

3. **Updated Deployment Script Paths**
   - `deploy_dokploy.sh` now uses the new directory structure
   - Generated files are placed in their proper locations:
     - Environment files â†’ `deployment/env/`
     - Deployment instructions â†’ `docs/deployment/`
     - Test scripts â†’ `scripts/`

## How to Organize Your Files

To organize your project files according to the plan:

1. **Review the Organization Plan**
   ```bash
   # Open the file organization plan
   cat FILE_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
   ```

2. **Run the Organization Script**
   ```bash
   # Execute the script to automatically organize files
   python organize_files.py
   ```

3. **Verify the New Structure**
   ```bash
   # Check that files have been properly moved
   dir
   ```

## Project Structure After Organization

After running the organization script, your project will have this clean structure:

```
mcp-server/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                         # Application source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server/                  # Server implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                   # MCP tools
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/                   # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                      # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/                  # Deployment files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dokploy/                 # Dokploy deployment
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env/                     # Environment templates
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                        # Documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                     # API documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/              # Deployment guides
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migration/               # Project reorganization docs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ security/                # Security documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                       # Test suite
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ unit/                    # Unit tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integration/             # Integration tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ security/                # Security tests
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                     # Utility scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/                    # Example code
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/                     # Deprecated files
â””â”€â”€ [essential root files]       # README.md, Dockerfile.production, etc.
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

- **Professional Organization**: Industry-standard project layout
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Code, config, docs, and tests are separate
- **Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify files
- **Improved Collaboration**: Standard structure helps team members
- **Cleaner Root Directory**: Only essential files remain in the root
- **Historical Reference**: Old files archived rather than deleted

## Next Steps

After organizing your files:

1. Update import statements if needed
2. Run tests to ensure everything works with the new structure
3. Commit the changes to your repository
4. Deploy using the instructions in `docs/deployment/`
